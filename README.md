# CS-5330-Pattern-Recognition-and-Computer-Vision

This Repository has the following sub projects. 
1. Assignment 1: Aka Filtering Project    
Applies negative effect, blur, cartoonize, find edges,  etc to both images and video feed from live camera. Also allows the user to store the images with effects by pressing 's'.     
_Project Aim:_ Color Space exploration, datatype understanding and their prominence, ability to apply effects on still images and videos.

2. Assignment 2: Aka Content Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)     
<To be updated>    
     
3. Assignment 3: Real time 2D object recognition       
Applies techniques to threshold a foreground image from background to create binary image. Perform connected component analysis to find segments in the cleaned binary image to obtain region map. Finally for each major region, obtain the best label from pre-trained model (file with image file names,labels and features) based on the the chosen distance metric and chosen best label strategy.       
_Project Aim:_ Foreground & Background image analysis, Morphological operators, Segementation techniques, Moments & Hu moments of an object in an image, Label training and prediction.       
__Algorithms:__ K-Means Algorithm, Grasstransform Algorithm, Region Growing Algorithm, Segmentation Using Union-Find data structure, K-Nearest Neighbours Algorithm, Ostu Algorithm    
     
4. Assignment 4: Camera Calibration and Augemented reality
